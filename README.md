# iris-prediction-with-decision-tree
A tree based machine learning model trained on the popular iris data set is developed in the notebook provided. A saved '.sav' file of the developed model is also provided

### Data
The popular iris flower data set is used in this project. The dataset was downloaded directly from the datasets module of scikit learn python library. A description of the dataset can be found as an attribute of the python object created after loading the dataset.

### Analysis
The data analysis was carried out using the following python libraries;
<ul>
  <li> Pandas </li>
  <li> Numpy </li>
  <li> Matplotlib </li>
  <li> Seaborn </li>
</ul>

### Model
The machine learning model was developed using the decision tree classifier in the scikit learn library. An initial accuracy of 92% was gotten however, a 95% accuracy was achieved after applying some feature engineering techniques on the dataset
